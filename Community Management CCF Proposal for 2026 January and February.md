## What Is Community Management
The Community Management Team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channels and supports several regional and multilingual hubs. It also brings support to other workgroups in the ecosystem. While the core team is composed of designated moderators and community support, it also relies on volunteers. Together they make up a team of approximately more than 18 members.
Their role include:

* Welcoming and onboarding new members
* Enforcing community rules
* Promoting constructive discussions
* Organizing interactive events and quizzes with small incentives
* Providing internal training
* Enhancing problem resolution among other workgroups
* This proposal aims to fund operations 


## How We Used Past Funding during the last 2 months ## 
Due to the price decrease, we were able to cover one fewer month than originally expected. We provided sustained funding to the Moderators Community Team, enabling them to maintain a safe, fair, and engaging environment across the Qubic ecosystem. This includes managing moderation, community engagement, policy enforcement, support for other workgroups, multilingual assistance, and documentation across Discord and Telegram, as well as organizing activities to raise awareness and increase community engagement.

## Achievements and Implementations

|FIELD|IMPLEMENTATION|
| ---------|------------|
|**Support to other workgroups**| Assisting other community leads or members in solving issues and providing a smoother experience on our server|
|**Representation**|Integration into the Community Quorum structure, providing democratic input to community members when requested, we aim to transition to community focused governance|
|**Coverage**|Reduced moderation and support extended to mining pool-related queries and environments if requested|
|**Activities**|While we keep our expenses short we aim to increasa expansion when the situation improves|
|**Reactivity**|Providing a positive and confidential atmosphere for problem resolution through mediation, as soon as the protagonists are willing to participate|
|**Independence**|Leadership approved by Quorum; now structurally independent|

## Community Growth
Over the past two months, we have observed a decrease in Discord and Telegram users, with proportionally larger growth on Telegram. Although overall growth has retraced and the Community Team is pausing its efforts to expand, we still anticipate future growth, particularly on Telegram. However, we remain cautious, as the current situation makes any expansion tasks unnecessary for now. This aligns with the broader market outlook, and we expect conditions to improve once the market turns positive. Despite this temporary slowdown, the team is fully prepared to welcome new community members and expects user numbers to rise as adoption increases with important developments in the pipeline.

## Governance
In recent months, the governance structure based on the Community Quorum has been consolidating its importance, and proposals are becoming increasingly common for addressing day-to-day situations.
* Community Support and Moderators’ representation within the Community Quorum, complemented by the perspective and suggestions of admins, provides greater plurality and representativeness.
* The rest of the community is invited to participate in polls concerning community decisions. While the authority to modify or update rules lies with the Community Quorum, community polls serve as a reflection of collective sentiment and are crucial when controversial decisions arise.
* Guidelines and moderation policies have evolved through community feedback, public polls, and Community Quorum discussions. As the community matures, we aim to make polls a legitimate tool for shaping and adapting the shared framework across our social networks. In this regard, a new polling application will soon be released by the ecosystem team to help better reflect community sentiment based on Qubic stake.

## FAQ

### Q: What measures are in place to face volatility?

It helps manage budget during downturns and rewards during growth.

## Closing
The Community Team has achieved structural independence, and asks for decentralised funding to ensure the autonomy on the decisions making. Continued funding will allow the team to meet growing demands and maintain Qubic's standard for safety, engagement, and governance. Any excess resulting from positive price performance will be used to continue funding the Community Team beyond the period agreed upon in the proposal.

### We respectfully request the Quorum’s support for this funding proposal.

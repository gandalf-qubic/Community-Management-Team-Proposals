Send (000) billion QUBIC to wallet COMMUNJOHCBSTFQKYBCZQGXIPQADSJRODNZKKWBAEGVMZFATRTROETTCRVAI to support Community Management during the months of January and February. The Qubic amount was calculated using a valuation of (000) USDT per billion.

### 🗳️ Available Options:

> **Option 1**: ✅ Yes, approve the budget of (XXX) bln QUBIC.

## 👥 What Is Community Management?
The Community Management Team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channels and supports several regional and multilingual hubs. Community Management acts as a stabilizing layer between protocol development, governance and community participants. It also brings support to other workgroups in the ecosystem. While the core team is composed of designated moderators and community support, it also relies on volunteers. Together they make up a team of approximately more than 18 members.

**Their role include:**
<br/>🤝 Welcoming and onboarding new members
<br/>🛡️ Enforcing community rules
<br/>💬 Promoting constructive discussions
<br/>🎯 Organizing interactive events and quizzes with small incentives
<br/>🎓 Providing internal training
<br/>🔧 Enhancing problem resolution among other workgroups

## 🔍 How We Used Past Funding during the last 2 months ## 
Due to market conditions and price fluctuations, the Community Team applied its dynamic compensation model to remain within the allocated budget. Despite these adjustments, operations on Discord and Telegram continued uninterrupted, with a full focus on core moderation, governance support, and community safety.

Funding during this period enabled the Community Management Team to maintain a safe, fair, and engaging environment across the Qubic ecosystem. This included continuous moderation, community engagement, policy enforcement, support for other workgroups, multilingual assistance and documentation across Discord and Telegram.

## 🌱 Community Growth
Over the past two months, community growth has shown a slight contraction rather than expansion, largely reflecting broader market sentiment rather than platform-specific issues. On Telegram, this has manifested as a gradual decline of approximately 300 members driven by passive churn, with no sudden drops or structural problems observed. Given current conditions, expansion-focused initiatives have been intentionally deprioritized, as they are not critical at this stage. Despite this temporary retracement, the Telegram community remains structurally healthy and well positioned to regain momentum once market conditions improve and content distribution efforts are reactivated.

During the same period, Discord has continued to function as the primary coordination and discussion hub for the ecosystem. The server structure has been refined to better reflect ecosystem projects, with dedicated sections introduced and existing channels reorganized. This restructuring has significantly improved discussion quality by clearly separating general conversation, price-related topics, and ecosystem-specific discussions. As a result, disruptive behavior, low-value commentary, and FUD-driven activity have been largely contained, allowing investors and long-term supporters to engage in focused and meaningful conversations.

With a stable moderation framework and a well-defined server structure now in place, Discord is operationally prepared to accommodate renewed growth while preserving a constructive and organized community environment.

## 🏛️ Governance
In recent months, the governance structure based on the Community Quorum has been consolidating its importance, and proposals are becoming increasingly common for addressing day-to-day situations.
* Community Support and Moderators’ representation within the Community Quorum, complemented by the perspective and suggestions of admins, provides greater plurality and representativeness.

* The rest of the community is invited to participate in polls concerning community decisions. While the authority to modify or update rules lies with the Community Quorum, community polls serve as a reflection of collective sentiment and are crucial when controversial decisions arise. 
Community Management acts as the operational arm that translates governance outcomes into enforceable moderation actions and clear community-wide communication. This role ensures that decisions made through the Community Quorum are consistently applied across Discord and Telegram, preserving governance continuity and trust.

* Guidelines and moderation policies have evolved through community feedback, public polls, and Community Quorum discussions. As the community matures, we aim to make polls a legitimate tool for shaping and adapting the shared framework across our social networks. In this regard, a new polling application will soon be released by the ecosystem team to help better reflect community sentiment based on Qubic stake.


## 🧾 Budget breakdown
|CONCEPTS|JANUARY|VALUE IN $QUBIC|FEBRUARY|VALUE IN $QUBIC|TOTAL VALUE IN $QUBIC|
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|**Salaries**|$11250| 000 Billion $QUBIC|$11250|000 Billion $QUBIC| 000 Billion $QUBIC|
|**Activities***| - | - | - | - | - |
|**TOTAL**|$11250| 000 Billion $QUBIC|$11250|000 Billion $QUBIC| 000 Billion $QUBIC|

**Salaries cover full-time and part-time moderators based on workload, responsibility with the dynamic salary model described below.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We apply a **dynamic salary model** based on price tiers. A 3-level salary system, subject to modifications, adjusts compensation based on Qubic price. If the price drops below set thresholds, salaries are reduced accordingly. If the price rises again, salaries are restored to higher levels. This model aligns compensation with market performance. It helps manage budget during downturns and rewards during growth. This model has already been applied in practice and allows the Community Team to remain operational without requiring emergency budget revisions.
<br/><br/>Monthly salary expenses have been reduced from **$16K** to **$11K**, representing an approximate **30% reduction** in response to current PA conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have been hosting consistent weekly fun activities for the community for more than a year. The server has approximately ~60,000 members, with ~0.03–0.17% active participation of the total server size. Activities include/included weekly game nights, quiz nights, and occasional activities based on major events around the project. Some activities were paused in-between as well as the allocated budget. Overall participation is consistent, indicating a stable and engaged community base capable of supporting the proposed initiative. <br/>(Amount spent in last 3 months $1080 worth of $QUBIC)
<br/><br/>The community team will be taking a break from hosting activities to get a new refresh. There were some malicious practices detected from a group of people aiming only to extract and not providing value in any of the other aspects of the project. We highly value true support and engagement so this pause will help us in filtering. We plan to continue these later this year and even open to new ideas and type of activities

## 📌 Closing
The Community Team has achieved structural independence, and asks for decentralised funding to ensure the autonomy on the decisions making. Continued funding will allow the team to meet growing demands and maintain Qubic's standard for safety, engagement, and governance. Any excess resulting from positive price performance will be used to continue funding the Community Team beyond the period agreed upon in the proposal.

### 🙏 We respectfully request the Quorum’s support for this funding proposal.

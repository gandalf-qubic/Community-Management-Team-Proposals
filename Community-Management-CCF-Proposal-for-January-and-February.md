## 👥 What Is Community Management?
The Community Management Team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channels and supports several regional and multilingual hubs. Community Management acts as a stabilizing layer between protocol development, governance and community participants. It also brings support to other workgroups in the ecosystem. While the core team is composed of designated moderators and community support, it also relies on volunteers. Together they make up a team of approximately more than 18 members.

**Their role include:**
<br/>🤝 Welcoming and onboarding new members
<br/>🛡️ Enforcing community rules
<br/>💬 Promoting constructive discussions
<br/>🎯 Organizing interactive events and quizzes with small incentives
<br/>🎓 Providing internal training
<br/>🔧 Enhancing problem resolution among other workgroups

## 🔍 How We Used Past Funding during the last 2 months ## 
Due to market conditions and price fluctuations, the Community Team applied its dynamic compensation model to remain within the allocated budget. Despite these adjustments, operations on Discord and Telegram continued uninterrupted, with a full focus on core moderation, governance support, and community safety.

Funding during this period enabled the Community Management Team to maintain a safe, fair, and engaging environment across the Qubic ecosystem. This included continuous moderation, community engagement, policy enforcement, support for other workgroups, multilingual assistance and documentation across Discord and Telegram, as well as organizing low-cost activities aimed at raising awareness and sustaining community engagement.

## 🌱 Community Growth
Community growth has remained relatively stable in the past two months, with no significant increase in overall user numbers. During periods of limited growth, the Community Team operates in a maintenance-focused mode, ensuring community stability, preserving institutional knowledge, and maintaining a safe and organized environment. This approach allows the ecosystem to remain prepared for renewed growth once broader market conditions and upcoming protocol developments drive increased adoption. In this context, to improve the user experience on Discord, the Proposals, Ecosystem Projects, and Community channels have been converted to a forum-based structure. This update has resulted in a cleaner, more organized, and user-friendly server structure.

## 🏛️ Governance
In recent months, the governance structure based on the Community Quorum has been consolidating its importance, and proposals are becoming increasingly common for addressing day-to-day situations.
* Community Support and Moderators’ representation within the Community Quorum, complemented by the perspective and suggestions of admins, provides greater plurality and representativeness.

* The rest of the community is invited to participate in polls concerning community decisions. While the authority to modify or update rules lies with the Community Quorum, community polls serve as a reflection of collective sentiment and are crucial when controversial decisions arise. 
Community Management acts as the operational arm that translates governance outcomes into enforceable moderation actions and clear community-wide communication. This role ensures that decisions made through the Community Quorum are consistently applied across Discord and Telegram, preserving governance continuity and trust.

* Guidelines and moderation policies have evolved through community feedback, public polls, and Community Quorum discussions. As the community matures, we aim to make polls a legitimate tool for shaping and adapting the shared framework across our social networks. In this regard, a new polling application will soon be released by the ecosystem team to help better reflect community sentiment based on Qubic stake.

**Salaries cover full-time and part-time moderators based on workload, responsibility with the dynamic salary model described below. Activities include community engagement initiatives, quizzes, games and low-cost incentives.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *We apply a **dynamic salary model** based on price tiers. A 3-level salary system, subject to modifications, adjusts compensation based on token price. If the price drops below set thresholds, salaries are reduced accordingly. If the price rises again, salaries are restored to higher levels. This model aligns compensation with market performance. It helps manage budget during downturns and rewards during growth. This model has already been applied in practice and allows the Community Team to remain operational without requiring emergency budget revisions.
<br/><br/>Activities have been suspended until the price returns to higher levels.*

## 📌 Closing
The Community Team has achieved structural independence, and asks for decentralised funding to ensure the autonomy on the decisions making. Continued funding will allow the team to meet growing demands and maintain Qubic's standard for safety, engagement, and governance. Any excess resulting from positive price performance will be used to continue funding the Community Team beyond the period agreed upon in the proposal.

### 🙏 We respectfully request the Quorum’s support for this funding proposal.
